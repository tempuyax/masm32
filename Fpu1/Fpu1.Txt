Within the floating point data types, three sizes of real numbers are available:

the 32-bit REAL4 (also called short real or single precision), 			= DWORD 4
the 64-bit REAL8 (also called long real or double precision),  			= QWORD 8
the 80-bit REAL10 (also called temporary real or extended precision). 	= TBYTE 16

=========================================================
The REAL4 floating point number has the following format.

where: 
S 	= sign bit (0=positive, 1=negative) 	BIT31 
En 	= biased exponent bits  				BIT30 - BIT23
fn 	= fraction bits of the significand		BIT22 - BIT00

The 24 bits describing the number (23 bits in the significand field + 1 implied bit) 
is approximately equivalent to 7 decimal digits.

=========================================================
The REAL8 floating point number has the following format.

where: 
S 	= sign bit (0=positive, 1=negative) 	BIT63 
En 	= biased exponent bits  				BIT62 - BIT52
fn 	= fraction bits of the significand		BIT51 - BIT00

The 53 bits describing the number (52 bits in the significand field + 1 implied bit) 
is approximately equivalent to 15 decimal digits.

==========================================================
The REAL10 floating point number has the following format. 
That is the format used by the FPU's 80-bit data registers. 
(Real numbers in this format can be stored in memory but 
must be present in one of the FPU data registers in order
to use them with other FPU instructions.)


where: 
S 	= sign bit (0=positive, 1=negative) 	BIT79 
En 	= biased exponent bits  				BIT78 - BIT64
1	= this bit must be 1					BIT63
fn 	= fraction bits of the significand		BIT62 - BIT00

The 64 bits of the significand describing the number is approximately equivalent to 19 decimal digits.
